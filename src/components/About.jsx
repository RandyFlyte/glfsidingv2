                        I started web developement in 2013 managing multiple
                        e-commerce websites on CMS platforms such as WordPress,
                        BigCommerce, and Shopify. I have experience working
                        directly with clients and taking mock wireframes all the
                        way to deployed applications. In my spare time I run
                        Code Commerce, a Youtube channel where I teach web
                        developement and various front-end technologies.
